      "I’m 27. I graduated from a technical university as a civil engineer. I like to design and create construction drawings. But one day I tried to write a simple JavaScript program and I couldn't stop. In my opinion, programming is a conditional design of \"buildings\", \"cities\", but it differs only in the implementation of the finished product. For example, microservices are created as “buildings” with their own internal infrastructure.",
      "The more I learn JavaCript the more I like it, and amaze me. It gets a lot of interesting and cool features every year. For this reason, it pleases developers and new adherents of this programming language who want to feel its power :)",
      "At the moment I am interested front-end (little back-end), but in the future I want to move on to back-end development. At the same time, it's a wish to try other server-side development languages (Java or Go).",
      "There is a lot of interest in the Linux ecosystem and technical innovations. Most of all I regret that there are 24 hours in a day..."
